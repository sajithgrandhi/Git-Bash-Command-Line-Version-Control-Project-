The project is designed to demonstrate the practical use of Git Bash and GitHub as part of the Fundamentals of DevOps (INT-331) course.

The main objective of this project is not only to build a basic student management interface, but also to apply version control concepts such as repository initialization, branching, merging, conflict resolution, and remote repository synchronization.

🎯 Objectives

Understand Git version control concepts

Practice Git Bash commands

Work with GitHub remote repositories

Create and manage multiple branches

Perform merges and resolve merge conflicts

Maintain a clean and meaningful commit history

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the application

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Student record logic

Git Bash – Version control operations

GitHub – Remote repository hosting

🌿 Branching Strategy

The following branches were created and used during development:

main – Stable production-ready code

feature – Feature development

test – Testing-related changes

bugfix – Bug fixing

experiment – Experimental changes

🔄 Git Workflow Used

The project followed a standard Git workflow:

Initialize → Add → Commit → Branch → Checkout → Merge → Push → Pull

🔧 Git Commands Used
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"
git branch
git checkout <branch-name>
git merge <branch-name>
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main

⚠️ Merge Conflict Handling

Merge conflicts were intentionally created

Conflicts occurred during branch merging

Conflicts were resolved manually

Changes were committed after resolution

This helped in understanding real-world collaboration scenarios.

🧪 Testing

Verified page loading and UI functionality

Checked JavaScript logic for student record handling

Ensured proper Git command execution

Validated branch merging and conflict resolution

📌 GitHub Integration

Local repository connected to GitHub using git remote add origin

All branches pushed to GitHub

Repository kept synchronized using git pull and git push

📸 Screenshots

The following screenshots are included in the project report:

✅ Outcome

Gained hands-on experience with Git and GitHub

Learned effective branching and merging strategies

Understood conflict resolution techniques

Applied DevOps fundamentals in a practical project
